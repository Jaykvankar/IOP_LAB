## 📂 Code Structure
-Each file follows the naming convention 'Q#', where'Q' signifies 'Question'.

## Requirements - **Compiler**: GCC or any other C compiler
- **IDE**: Optional (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code)
- **Libraries**: `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`

## 🛠️ Setup. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the assignment files.
3. Open the files in your preferred IDE or text editor.

## Step 1. Compile the C programs using the command:
gcc -o program_name program_name.c
## Step 2. Run the C programs using the command:
./program_name
